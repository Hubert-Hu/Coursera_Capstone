# Introduction:

Problem: For a new business owner, where do you suggest them to open a new Asian-style restaurant?\

Usually for a certain district, same type of restaurants tends to cluster due to the certain type of population clustering or certain type of business around.
If one wants to open a new Asian-style restaurant, where in the New Your do you suggest him to start?

Question:  1, How many types of restaurant clusters?
           2, Where do these clusters locate in the city?
           3, Where is the Asian-style restaurant cluster?
           
           
   
           
# Data:

The data will be from Foursquare location data. 

I will search all the venues including 'restaurant' string near the center of New York city with a huge limit which almost covers the majority part of the city. Each row of the dataframe will present one restaurant with longtitude, latitude, venues type.

Based on the longtitude, latitude, we will cluster the restaurants into different areas. Then we will add Cluster Number column into the dataframe.

Then we can build a new dataframe. Each row is a Cluster with cluster number, cluster center, cluster radius, number of each type of restaurants.

Then we cluster this new dataframe into different type. We can then plot different type of clusters by the cluster center and radius. We examine each type and find out the feature of each type and which one is good for a Asian-type restaurant. Then we circle them in the map.
